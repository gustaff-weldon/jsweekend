# JS Weekend

> An intensive weekend React workshop with Kiwi.com developers

## About

See our website: https://www.kiwi.com/jsweekend/

The goal of this workshop is to show you some great tools and best practices for
building React application. During two weekend days you'll learn how to fetch
data with Relay Modern from GraphQL backend, enrich Javascript with static
types due to Flow, write test, create re-usable React components and setup
continuous deployment.

The workshop is divided into four blocks plus one short introduction. Each block
corresponds to a directory containing the desired source code we'll try to create.

## Installation

There are no complicated dependencies. All you need is [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) installed, everything else will be installed
from NPM.

## Table of Contents

* [Requirements](#requirements)
* [How to install](#how-to-install)
* [Where to start](#where-to-start)
* [Technologies used](#technologies)

## Requirements

This project requires the following to be installed.

* [Node.js 8+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

## How to Install

If you have everything from [Requirements](#requirements) then you can simply run: `yarn`.

This project uses [Yarn Workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) so all the project dependencies for all the folders will be installed automatically.

In each block/directory, you'll find a working application. Check out the readme
file if you want to run it.

## Where to start

The application you should start with is in a directory
[start](https://github.com/kiwicom/jsweekend/tree/master/start). Feel free to make all your changes here.

All other folders contain ready made parts of our final application. If you get stuck or can't keep up you can use the code from these folders to help yourself catch up with the rest or see how we've handled a problem you may have come across.
