# JS Weekend

> An intensive weekend React workshop with Kiwi.com developers

## About

The goal of this workshop is to show you some great tools and best practices for
building React application. During two weekend days you'll learn how to fetch
data with Relay Modern from GraphQL backend, enrich Javascript with static
types due to Flow, write test, create re-usable React components and setup
continuous deployment.

The workshop is divided into four blocks plus one short introduction. Each block
corresponds to a directory containing the desired source code we'll try to create.

## Installation

from NPM.

In each block/directory, you'll find a working application. Check out the readme
